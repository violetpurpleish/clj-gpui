(defn label
  "A text label (Kit `Label`). Optional style map uses GPUI-oriented keys,
  not CSS.

  `:truncate true` is GPUI `truncate()`: no wrap, clip overflow, and an
  ellipsis at the end. That is layout clip, not a guessed character
  count. `:whitespace :nowrap` and `:text-overflow` (`:ellipsis`,
  `:ellipsis-start`, `:ellipsis-middle`) are the same GPUI text styles
  separately. `:overflow :hidden` / `:overflow-hidden true` clip the
  box. `:line-clamp n` keeps at most n lines. A StatusBar region already
  clips; put `:truncate true` (and `:flex 1` when the text should fill
  leftover width) on the label or shimmer. `:flex 1` with truncate
  shrinks on the width axis (`min_w_0`) and keeps line height — it does
  not also `min_h_0`, which would collapse an auto-height row to empty.

  Kit extras: `:secondary` is muted trailing text, `:masked true` paints
  bullets, `:highlights` is the search string (`:highlights-match
  :prefix` or `:full`, default full). `:masked` folds `:secondary` into
  the bullet string and skips `:highlights`: Kit 0.6 measures original
  UTF-8 byte ranges after swapping in U+2022 glyphs, which is not a
  char-boundary-safe `StyledText` paint.

  `nil` clears the selection. `:searchable true` filters options by

  Nested `:items` are Kit `SelectGroup` sections (`IndexPath` section+row
  on the host). A group is `{ :label \"Lisp\" :items [{:id :clj :label \"Clojure\"}] }`.
  Option `:display` is the string form of Kit `SelectItem::display_title`
  (trigger copy); Kit's API is `Option<AnyElement>`. Omitted, the trigger
  uses `:label`. `:disabled` greys a row.

  A controlled value change uses Kit `set_selected_value` so a live
  search query is not indexed with a full-list `IndexPath`. Native
  Confirm updates the host cache first: Clojure echoing that id is a
  no-op and does not clear in-progress typing. Replacing the option
  collection rebuilds `SelectState` so query text and matched rows
  agree; an unrelated rerender with the same options and id does not.

  Kit Select chrome: `:cleanable`, `:title-prefix`, `:menu-width` /
  `:menu-max-h` (px), `:search-placeholder`, `:empty` (string form of
  Kit `Select::empty`; Kit accepts arbitrary `IntoElement`), `:icon`,
  `:appearance`, `:focus-ring` (Kit `FocusableExt`; omit = Kit true),
  `:accessibility-label`. Kit 0.6.1's styled Select does not forward its
  base dismiss event, so there is deliberately no `:on-dismiss`; selection
  confirmation remains distinct from merely closing the menu. Group titles are not selectable and are not
  in the callback id map. Custom row/section `render` is not wrapped.

(defn combobox
  "Searchable dropdown. Kit `Combobox`. `value` is the selected option
  id, or a vector of ids when `:multiple true`. `:on-change` receives
  that id (or vector). `:on-confirm` fires when the menu closes.
  Search is on by default.

  Nested `:items` are Kit `SelectGroup` sections (`SearchableGroup`;
  leaf values stay the option id). A group is
  `{ :label \"Lisp\" :items [{:id :clj :label \"Clojure\"}] }`.
  Group titles are not selectable and are not in the callback id map.

  Kit Combobox chrome: `:cleanable`, `:menu-width` / `:menu-max-h` (px),
  `:search-placeholder`, `:empty` (string form of Kit `Combobox::empty`;
  Kit accepts arbitrary `IntoElement`), `:icon` (trigger chevron),
  `:check-icon` (selected-row mark), `:appearance`, `:focus-ring`
  (Kit `FocusableExt`; omit = Kit true). `:query` is programmatic
  search text (`ComboboxState::query` / `set_query`):
  omitted or `nil` releases control and leaves the native query;
  `\"clj\"` sets it; `\"\"` clears it. Kit `ComboboxEvent` has no
  query variant, so there is no `:on-query` (unlike `ui/command`).
  Custom `render_trigger` / `footer` and empty as `IntoElement` are
  not wrapped.

  A single-select pick can emit Kit `Change` then `Confirm` for one
  user action. The host sends `:on-change` then `:on-confirm` as one
  batch against the same callback generation, then fetches one tree.
  Confirm without Change (dismiss) is `:on-confirm` only.

  Controlled selection is pushed to Kit when the ids change *or* the
  option collection changes. Flat comboboxes `set_items` then
  `set_selected_values` (cloned selection would otherwise keep old
  labels). Grouped comboboxes rebuild `ComboboxState` on a collection
  fingerprint change so query text and matched sections agree. Kit
  `set_selected_values` clears the search query, so an unrelated atom
  rerender with the same options and ids must not wipe in-progress
  typing. A present `:query` (including `\"\"`) is applied after that
  write so a controlled filter survives a selection sync. `nil` /
  omitted is not present: native typing is left alone. A native
  `Change` updates the host cache first: Clojure echoing those same
  ids is a no-op; a different Clojure value still overrides native
  state.

(defn dialog
  "Modal dialog on the overlay layer. Controlled by `open?` (or `:open?`).

  Not painted inline — the host opens it through GPUI Kit `Root`.
  The open dialog always uses the latest Clojure tree: callback ids,
  title, and body update on the next paint without closing. `:on-close`
  is 0-arg. `:on-ok` / `:on-cancel` are 0-arg. Crate order per action:

  * OK → `:on-ok`, then `:on-close` (and `:on-open-change false`)
  * Cancel, Escape, close button, overlay click → `:on-cancel`, then
    `:on-close` (and `:on-open-change false`)

  The host sends that whole chain as one batch against the same callback
  generation, then fetches one tree. `:on-ok` cannot re-export and rewire
  `:on-close`. Each handler runs at most once per action. `:variant` is
  `:confirm` (OK+Cancel) or omitted (content + close button). Alerts that
  must not dismiss on backdrop use `ui/alert-dialog`. Clicking the dimmed
  overlay dismisses a generic dialog unless `:overlay-closable false`.
  Confirm dialogs follow Kit (not overlay-closable unless you set it).
  `:ok-text` / `:cancel-text` and named `:ok-variant` / `:cancel-variant`
  are Kit `DialogButtonProps`. `:close-button` (omit = Kit true) and
  `:keyboard` (Escape; omit = Kit true) are Kit Dialog chrome.

(defn native-menu
  "OS-native popup menu. Kit `NativeMenu`.

  Clojure owns the semantic tree: item ids, labels, order, nesting,
  disabled/checked, icons, and what selecting an item means. The host
  materializes that tree into Kit `NativeMenu` when `:open?` becomes
  true (a presentation snapshot). Selecting an item reports its
  semantic id; Clojure updates state; the next open rebuilds from that
  state. The host does not own checked/toggled menu state.

  Kit requires a GPUI `Action` per row. The host attaches a generic
  Action with a stable menu slot plus semantic `item_path` (submenu
  identities, then the leaf id), then resolves the live Clojure
  callback when that Action is dispatched. It does not capture a
  generated `cb-N` (an unrelated `export-tree` while the OS menu is
  open must not stale the Action). Duplicate leaf ids in different
  submenus stay distinct because the path includes each submenu.

  `:open?` is a show request. The host shows once on the false→true
  edge, then sends `:on-open-change false` so Clojure can consume it.
  The OS menu remaining visible is not tracked (Kit has no dismiss
  callback). `:position [x y]` is window logical pixels; omitted uses
  the current mouse position. Item `:on-click` then menu `:on-change`
  is one batch, same as `ui/dropdown-menu`. Parent `:on-change` receives
  the original leaf id, or a path vector `[submenu-id leaf-id]` when
  the leaf is nested, so duplicate submenu leaves stay distinct.
  Display either shape with `format-option-id`.
  Nested `:items` are submenus. `-` / `:-` is a separator.
  `:disabled true` on a submenu wrapper is forwarded. Kit's
  `NativeMenu::submenu` builder always creates an enabled submenu; the
  host uses `From<gpui::Menu>` when any wrapper is disabled. That
  conversion has no icon field, so a snapshot that contains a disabled
  submenu drops leaf icons. Enabled-only menus keep NativeMenu builders
  and icons.

  Kit's public NativeMenu builders cannot combine a check mark with an
  icon or with disabled. Icon (including icon+disabled) wins over a
  check. When there is no icon, disabled wins over checked — the check
  mark is dropped so the OS row stays inert.

(defn command
  "Command palette. Kit `Command` with host-held `CommandState`.

  Clojure owns the entries (ids, labels, groups, disabled/checked,
  icons, keywords). Confirm dispatches the same generic host Action as
  `ui/native-menu` (`slot` + `item_path`), then Clojure's `:on-change`
  receives the original leaf id, or a path vector `[group-id leaf-id]`
  for a grouped leaf so duplicate ids round-trip through controlled
  `:selected`. Kit `on_confirm` is a separate route: `:on-confirm`
  fires after that Action, same payload, in one batch with
  `:on-change`.   `:on-select` is highlight only (arrows / hover),
  not confirmation; the host installs it only when this callback is
  present. Display the payload with `format-option-id`; `name` throws
  on a path vector.

  Nested `:items` are Kit `CommandGroup` sections. Group titles are
  not selectable. Group identities are in the parent-callback id map
  so a path vector can restore both segments (first-wins if a group
  wire id collides with a leaf). Duplicate leaf ids under two groups
  stay distinct on the Action path (group identity then leaf).
  `-` / `:-` is a top-level separator. Search is
  on by default. `:filterable false` keeps the query field but skips
  local filtering (`:on-query` still fires). `:query` is programmatic
  search text (`CommandState::query` / `set_query`). `:selected` /
  `:value` is the highlighted leaf id, or a path vector to
  disambiguate duplicate ids (`CommandState::selected_index`).
  The host consumes Kit `Command::render` (`install_model`) before
  applying those controlled fields, so an initial `:selected` and a
  same-tree item replacement resolve against the current model, not
  the empty default.   Native `:on-select` / `:on-query` hold an echo
  latch until the matching callback-seq tree; that tree's Clojure
  value then wins even when it differs from what native emitted.
  The latch is bound when the callback batch is actually sent
  (including a delayed flush after an in-flight callback), not only
  when the native event first queued. Unrelated `request-render`
  trees do not release it.
  `:focus` focuses the query field when searchable. `:loading` is the
  search-field spinner. `:bordered false` drops Kit's surrounding
  chrome (default true). `:menu-max-h` is Kit `Command::max_h` in px
  (not widget `:height`). `:on-query` receives the search string.
  `:on-cancel` is 0-arg (empty-query Escape). String `:empty` is the
  string form of Kit `Command::empty`. `CommandItem::child` and
  arbitrary empty/header/footer `AnyElement` are not wrapped.
  `CommandState::matched_count` is native-only (not on the wire).

  selected id; `on-change` receives that original Clojure id.

  `:on-change` fires when selection changes (arrow keys, and also the
  selection implied by a confirm). `:on-confirm` fires when the item is
  activated (mouse click or Enter). Kit emits Select for
  arrows and Confirm only for click/Enter; the host maps those to this
  contract. Click/Enter is one batch: `:on-change` then `:on-confirm`
  against the same callback generation, then one tree fetch. Escape /
  Cancel sends `on-change` with `nil`. `:searchable true` filters by
  label and keeps that query when Clojure replaces the rows.
  `:search-placeholder` is Kit `search_placeholder`.
  `:scrollbar false` hides the list scrollbar (omit = Kit true).
  `:selectable false` is Kit `ListState::selectable` (omit = Kit true).
  String `:empty` is `render_empty`. `:loading` / `:has-more` /
  `:on-load-more` (0-arg) / `:load-more-threshold` are the delegate
  load-more surface (Kit default threshold 20). The host latches
  `load_more` only after a callback is sent, and resets that latch
  when rows / `:has-more` / `:loading` change or when `:on-load-more`
  appears (`nil` → present). A regenerated wire id (`cb-1` → `cb-2`)
  for the same handler does not reset it. Custom empty widgets are
  not wrapped.

(defn data-table
  "Virtualized data table (Kit DataTable). `:columns` are `{id, label, width}`
  maps (not the description-list `:columns` count). `:rows` are
  `{id, cells [...]}`. A cell is a string or a supported RenderOnce
  cell node (progress, tag, badge, avatar, stacks, …). Kit `render_td`
  paints that node via the overlay static painter; stateful widgets
  such as input, editor, list, and data-table are not their real
  implementations there. The host does not stringify widget cells.
  `on-change` receives the selected row's original
  id, or `{:row … :col …}` when `:cell-selectable` is on. `:on-confirm`
  (or `:on-double-click`) fires on double-click with that same payload.
  Kit `on_row_left_click` always emits `SelectRow`; when `click_count`
  is 2 it then emits `DoubleClickedRow` from that same call. Cell mode
  uses `SelectCell` / `DoubleClickedCell`. A count-1 click is only
  `:on-change` (deferred to the end of the GPUI effect cycle). A
  count-2 click is `:on-change` then `:on-confirm` as one batch against
  one callback generation, then one tree fetch. Programmatic `:selected`
  does not emit `:on-change`. String `:selected` is a row id; a map
  `{:row :col}` or `[row col]` is Kit `set_selected_cell`.

  `:header-groups` is Kit `group_headers` (rows of `{:label :span}`).
  `:cell-selectable` is Kit `TableState::cell_selectable` (omit = false).
  `:row-header` is the row-index column in cell mode (omit = Kit true).
  Pixel `:row-height` is Kit `Size::Size` (`table_row_height`). Named
  `:size` is control size. Viewport `:height` is the outer wrapper.
  `:export-generation` plus `:on-export` dumps native `headers` / `rows`
  (column order after a header drag). `:on-export` is dump text — it
  does not restore option ids. Widget cells export `text` / `value`
  (a progress bar dumps its number). Row and column ids are separate
  namespaces: a row `:lang` and a column `\"lang\"` both wire to
  `\"lang\"` and restore independently.

  `:stripe` is Kit `DataTable::stripe` (omit = false). `:bordered`
  omit = Kit true. `:scrollbar false` hides both axes (omit = true).
  TableState: `:sortable` / `:col-movable` / `:col-resizable` /
  `:col-fixed` / `:loop-selection` / `:row-selectable` /
  `:col-selectable` (omit = Kit true except where noted). Omitted
  flags restore those Kit defaults on every tree. Column `:sort`
  (`:asc` / `:desc` / `true` for Default) or `:sortable true` opts a
  header into sorting. An initial `:sort :asc` / `:desc` sorts the
  first paint, not only later header clicks. Header click cycles
  Default → Desc → Asc → Default, sorts in-memory by `cell_text`
  (numeric when both parse), remaps the active logical row or cell
  selection by row id (Kit can leave the other slot populated) without
  emitting `:on-change`, and sends `:on-sort` `{:id :sort}`.
  `Default` restores the last Clojure row order. A later row-only tree
  with the same fingerprint keeps native order. Column `:fixed` /
  `:fixed-left` (`true` or `:left`), `:resizable`, `:movable`,
  `:min-width` / `:max-width`. String `:empty` is `render_empty`.
  `:loading` / `:has-more` / `:on-load-more` (0-arg) /
  `:load-more-threshold` (omit = 20). The host latches `load_more`
  only after a callback is sent, and resets that latch when rows /
  `:has-more` / `:loading` change or when `:on-load-more` appears
  (`nil` → present). A regenerated wire id (`cb-1` → `cb-2`) for the
  same handler does not reset it. Context menus and custom
  `render_th` / `render_loading` are not wrapped.

  `ui/table` is Kit's declarative (non-virtualized) Table.

(defn table
  "Declarative Kit Table. Not virtualized — use `ui/data-table` for
  large row sets.

  Convenience APIs may simplify Kit, but they must not hide it.
  The Kit primitives are always available:

  (ui/table
    (ui/table-header
      (ui/table-row
        (ui/table-head \"Name\")

  `table-head` and `table-cell` accept any clj-gpui children, not only

  screen reader announces). A visible `:caption` is not used as that name.

  `{:columns … :rows … :footer … :caption …}` remains as shorthand and
  expands into those primitives. Column `:span` applies to the header
  cell only, not every body cell. Column `:align` / `:width` copy onto
  plain string cells. A footer cell may span independently:

  "Series chart. `kind` is `:line` (default), `:bar`, `:area`, `:pie`,
  `:radar`, `:candlestick`, or `:sankey`.

  Convenience helpers (`horizontal-bar-chart`, `radar-chart`, …) stay;
  `ui/chart` itself does not hide Kit 0.6 builders. Points are
  `{id, label, value}` maps (`:values` for multi-series area/radar).
  Bar charts take Kit `:alignment` (`:bottom` default, `:left` for
  horizontal bars growing right). `:labels true` paints values on bars
  or pie slice labels. Bar points may set `:display` (Kit
  `BarChart::label`; omitted formats the value) and `:fill` (hex,
  `{:color}`, or two `{color, at}` stops with `:space :bar|:chart`).
  `:space :bar` is stop 0 = base (zero) and stop 1 = tip when `:angle`
  is omitted; a negative value flips that default angle 180°. An
  explicit `:angle` is bar-local and chooses the gradient direction.
  `:space :chart` remaps those two stops through pixel bounds on the
  alignment value axis and always uses `BarAlignment::gradient_angle`
  (`:angle` is dropped). Chart-level `:fill` is the default when a
  point omits `:fill` / `:color`. `:fill-gradient` still maps to Kit
  `fill_gradient` and replaces `fill`. Radar dimensions may use
  `:values [a b]` (or `:value [a b]`) with `:series` names/colors/fills. Candlesticks use
  `:open` / `:high` / `:low` / `:close`. Sankey nodes are `points`;
  flows are `:links [{:source :target :value}]`.

  Kit-named options include `:name`, `:stroke`, `:stroke-style`
  (`:natural` / `:linear` / `:step-after`), `:dot`, `:tick-margin`

  `:grid-levels`, `:body-width-ratio` (unclamped), `:interactive`

  `:node-padding` / `:iterations` / `:node-corner-radius` /
  `:link-opacity` / `:min-link-width` / `:label-lines`. Pie slices may
  set per-item `:inner-radius` / `:outer-radius` and `:color` (Kit
  `chart_2` when omitted). Radar `:content` is any clj-gpui widget.

(defn nav-stack
  "Kit `NavStack`. `:stack` (or `:value`) is page ids root-first.
  Children are `ui/nav-page` templates, not the live trail. Omitted
  stack is the first page id. An empty `:stack []` clears the stack.
  An explicit trail that names an unknown page id is rejected (the
  native stack is left unchanged); only `[]` means clear.
  Clojure owns the trail; the host preserves the longest matching
  active prefix and applies a plan of Kit `push` / `pop` /
  `forward` / `pop_to_root` / `replace`. Rebuild (`clear` +
  immediate pushes) is last resort: empty current, explicit `[]`,
  or a root id that cannot be `replace`d. Multi-step pops keep
  popped entities on the forward branch (Kit order). Restoring
  that same trail is the same number of `forward` calls, not a
  rebuild. Growing by an id that matches the nearest Kit
  `forward_views()` entry restores that retained page (`forward`)
  unless `:reuse-forward false`, which forces a fresh `push` and
  discards the remainder of the forward branch — the same Kit
  operation you would call yourself. Omitted / true keeps
  automatic `forward` as the convenient default. `:replace-generation`
  is an integer or string token. Changing it while the current page
  id stays the same creates a fresh page entity and calls Kit
  `replace()` (forward is kept, `NavOperation::Replace` uses the
  configured motion). Leaving the token unchanged across rerenders
  is a no-op, so ordinary callback-id regeneration still only
  `replace_live`s the existing page. The host binds the token to
  the current `CljNavPage` entity (not the catalog page id); a later
  navigation to another history entry — including another instance
  of the same page id — keeps the previous entity binding across
  ordinary rerenders. The next generation bump rebinds rather than
  replacing that other entity. Setting the trail to just the root from depth > 2 is one `pop_to_root` transition
  (popped pages join forward, nearest first). `:on-forward-change`
  receives Kit `forward_views()` as a vector of original page ids,
  nearest first (the id `forward` would restore). Empty after first
  mount is not sent; a later Push/Rebuild that clears forward still
  notifies `[]`. Catalog page ids should be unique (duplicate
  templates share a lookup key; the last wins). Repeated ids on
  the active trail are valid and create distinct entities.
  `:transition` is seconds (Kit `Transition` only); omitted is an
  immediate swap. `:motion :immediate` forces Immediate even when
  a transition is set. `:item` is Kit `NavStack::item`: a static
  recipe the host evaluates each frame on the retained `NavPage`
  (`view()`, `index`, `phase`, `operation`, eased `progress`).
  It is not a Clojure callback — `export-tree` is not per-frame.
  `:item :slide` (or `:transition-style :slide`) is the showcase
  slide; a map of `:match` arms (or a vector of those arms)
  Styled-refines the same page (`:left` / `:opacity` number or
  `{:from :to}` lerp by progress, plus the ordinary clj-gpui
  Styled vocabulary: `:padding`, `:bg`, `:color`, `:align`, …).
  An explicit non-nil `:item` wins over `:transition-style`,
  including an unknown name or a dropped Clojure fn (`false` on
  the wire). Those do not fall back to Slide. Omitted both keeps
  Kit's default unchanged `NavPage` renderer. This is a
  host-evaluated recipe, not Kit's arbitrary
  `Fn(NavPage, &mut Window, &mut App) -> AnyElement`. `:overflow :hidden` or
  `:overflow-hidden true` clips; omitted does not. Pages paint
  the overlay static subset (not list / data-table / editor).
