  "Register gpui-component ThemeSets from ordinary Clojure data.

  Required on each variant: `:name`, `:mode` (`:light` / `:dark`), and
  `:colors` (gpui-component tokens such as `:primary.background` → hex).
  Other ThemeConfig keys (`:highlight`, `:font.family`, `:font.size`,
  `:radius`, `:shadow`, `:is_default`, …) are kept and serialized with
  the same JSON field names gpui-component uses on disk.

  `(register!)` keeps sets in this process. The runtime sends them on each
  render; UI nodes still refer to a palette by `:theme` name (a string).

  Names are identified the same way as the host: trim, lowercase, treat
  `-` / `_` as spaces, collapse whitespace. `(ui/themes)` remains the
  palettes *shipped* with clj-gpui. Use `registered` / `available-names`
  for sets registered here."
