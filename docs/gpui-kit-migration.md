# GPUI Kit 0.6 migration plan

Status: **Kit 0.6 migration landed** on `main` ([PR #13](https://github.com/gitwyrm/clj-gpui/pull/13), `4fcf02e`). Phase 5 (declarative `ui/table`, Combobox / Rating / Stepper, `gpui-fps`, protocol 9) landed in [PR #14](https://github.com/gitwyrm/clj-gpui/pull/14). Extra Kit chart kinds (horizontal `BarChart` alignment, radar, candlestick, sankey) are protocol 10. NativeMenu / Command / StatusBar and nested menu/command path-vector parent callbacks are protocol 11.

The implemented 0.6.1 follow-up, validation results, and remaining deeper test inventory are tracked in [gpui-kit-0.6.1-todo.md](gpui-kit-0.6.1-todo.md).

Upstream: [GPUI Kit v0.6.0](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-kit/releases/tag/v0.6.0) (2026-09-03). Docs: [gpui-kit.com](https://gpui-kit.com). Source: [longbridge/gpui-kit](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-kit) tag `v0.6.0`.

This document is the course of action for moving clj-gpui off **gpui-component 0.5.1 + crates.io `gpui` 0.2.2** onto **GPUI Kit 0.6**. Decisions are locked in [§11](#11-decisions).

## Recommendation (read this first)

**Migrate the native host in one jump to `gpui-kit` 0.6, and take Kit's 0.6 names all the way through Clojure, the wire protocol, and the host. Do not keep 0.5.1 aliases.** Treat extra Kit widgets (Combobox, Rating, chat `Message`/`Bubble`, NavStack, …) as a second coverage pass after today's widgets paint under the new names.

That is the right course of action because:

1. **There is no incremental crate upgrade.** 0.6 does not sit on Zed's crates.io `gpui` 0.2.2. Kit publishes its own GPUI snapshot as `gpui-pre` 0.3.x (`package = "gpui-pre"`, imported as `gpui`). Mixing 0.5.1 widgets with 0.6 GPUI types will not compile.
2. **There is no compatibility audience.** clj-gpui is two days old, unpublished, and has no users. Keeping `ui/divider` / `ui/table` / `ui/text-field` would only freeze a 0.5.1 vocabulary we invented before Kit renamed the types. Matching Kit now means `gpui.ui` stays a thin naming layer over gpui-kit.com instead of a translation table we have to document forever.
3. **The three text controls should exist together.** 0.6 split `Input` / `Textarea` / `Editor`. Shipping `ui/input` and `ui/editor` while omitting `ui/textarea` would recreate the old "multiline lives on the wrong type" trap.

Do **not** adopt `gpui-shell` (JavaScript host). Clojure is already our scriptable layer. **`gpui-wry` (WebView) is deferred** until a product needs it; it is not part of the widget coverage pass. **`gpui-fps` is wanted** for `:chrome :dev`, but it is postponed past this migration.

                                   → gpui-pre 0.3.x
                                   → gpui-base 0.6
                                   → gpui-component 0.6
                                   → gpui-kit-assets 0.6
```

`ui/table` is reserved for Kit's new declarative `Table`. It is not an alias for DataTable.

Implementation is **one migration PR** covering crate bump, edition 2024, Kit names, `tree-sitter-languages`, and parity for today's widgets. Declarative `ui/table`, Combobox / Rating / Stepper, and `gpui-fps` are follow-ups. Full lock list: [§11](#11-decisions).

## 1. What changed upstream

The Longbridge project is no longer "a component crate on top of Zed's `gpui` crate." It is **GPUI Kit**: a layered toolkit that vendors GPUI because they did not want to wait for Zed to publish a new crates.io `gpui`.

| Layer | Crate | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Facade | `gpui-kit` 0.6.0 | One dependency. Re-exports GPUI as `gpui_kit::*`, plus `application()`, `init()`, and `actions!`. Default features: `component` + `assets`. |
| GPUI | `gpui-pre` 0.3.1 (workspace pin; 0.3.3 already on crates.io) | Zed GPUI snapshot (`zed@5b055fa`), published under `package = "gpui-pre"`. Applications import it as `gpui`. Matching crates: `gpui-pre-platform`, `gpui-pre-macros`, `gpui-pre-sum-tree`, … |
| Unstyled | `gpui-base` 0.6.0 | Behavior, state, overlays, dock layout algebra, input engine, motion, virtual lists. Independent of the styled theme. |
| Styled | `gpui-component` 0.6.0 | The widget library we wrap today. Still the right painting layer for clj-gpui. Builds on `gpui-base`. |
| Assets | `gpui-kit-assets` 0.6.0 | Replaces `gpui-component-assets`. Rust path `gpui_kit_assets`. Lucide SVGs; `IconName` is generated from this pack. |
| Out of scope for this migration | `gpui-shell` | JS runtime. Clojure replaces that use case; do not wrap. |
| Deferred | `gpui-wry` | Wry WebView. Later, when a product needs it. |
| Postponed | `gpui-fps` | FPS / resource HUD. Wanted on `:chrome :dev`; add after the host is on 0.6. |

Documentation moved from `longbridge.github.io/gpui-component` to [gpui-kit.com](https://gpui-kit.com). The GitHub repo is `longbridge/gpui-kit` (the old `gpui-component` repo is the 0.5 line).

Kit uses **Rust edition 2024**. The host will too. Edition 2021 on `host/Cargo.toml` was a mistake for a new project; the migration sets `edition = "2024"`. That needs rustc **1.85+**. This environment has rustc **1.98.1**; `rust-toolchain.toml` already tracks `stable`. README should require 1.85+ (recent stable).

Do not confuse this with **GPUI Box** (`gpui-box` / `gpui-box-kit` on crates.io). That is a different independent GPUI distribution. We want Longbridge **GPUI Kit**.

## 2. Where we are today

Pinned in `host/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
gpui = "0.2.2"
gpui-component = "0.5.1"
gpui-component-assets = "0.5.1"
```

Host edition is **2021** today (wrong for a new crate; migration moves it to **2024**). Clojure protocol version is **7**. Coverage inventory is [docs/gpui-component.md](gpui-component.md), which is explicitly "0.5.1, not later git main."

The host files that import GPUI / gpui-component:

| File | Why it matters for 0.6 |
|---|---|
| `host/src/main.rs` | `gpui::Application::new()` + `gpui_component_assets::Assets` + `gpui_component::init` |
| `host/src/renderer.rs` | Almost every widget, overlays, dock, editor `InputState::code_editor`, `Table::new`, `Divider`, `WindowExt`, `Root::render_*_layer` |
| `host/src/overlay.rs` | `Dialog::new(window, cx)`-era builders, `divider` in static paint, live spec cells |
| `host/src/mapping.rs` | `IconName`, `Divider` orientation helpers, sizes, placements |
| `host/src/rows.rs` | `ListDelegate` / `TableDelegate` (`column()` currently returns `&Column`) |
| `host/src/extra.rs` | Charts, markdown `TextView`, `CljPanel` (`zoomable` → `Option<PanelControl>`), settings, virtual lists |
| `host/src/catalog.rs` | Bundled ThemeSet JSON |
| `host/src/preview.rs`, `preview_macos.rs` | Window capture vs GPUI 0.2.2 occlusion (`zed#63217`). `inactive_frame_interval` was missing on 0.2.2; `gpui-pre` 0.3.x may have it. |
| `host/themes/*.json` | Copied from gpui-component 0.5.1 |

Clojure constructors in `src/gpui/ui.clj` still use 0.5.1 names (`text-field`, `divider`, `table`) and 0.5.1-specific comments (`InputState::code_editor`, table click batching). The migration rewrites those constructors and the examples/tests that call them.

## 3. Dependency shape

### 3.1 Facade crate, aliases in Rust

```toml
[package]
edition = "2024"

[dependencies]
gpui-kit = { version = "0.6.0", features = ["tree-sitter-languages"] }
# plus existing anyhow, serde, xcap, macos objc2, …
```

In `main.rs` / modules:

```rust
use gpui_kit::{self as gpui, application};
use gpui_kit::component as gpui_component;
use gpui_kit::assets as gpui_kit_assets;
use std::sync::Arc;

fn main() {
    application()
        .with_assets(gpui_kit_assets::Assets)
        .with_http_client(Arc::new(
            reqwest_client::ReqwestClient::user_agent("clj-gpui/host").unwrap(),
        ))
        .run(|cx| {
            gpui_kit::init(cx);
            // …
        });
}
```

Why this, not listing `gpui-pre` + `gpui-component` + `gpui-kit-assets` ourselves:

- Kit's job is to keep **matching** `gpui-pre` / `gpui-pre-platform` / macros versions together. Wrong mixes produce identical-looking `App` / `Window` types that are not the same crate.
- `gpui_kit::application()` is `gpui_platform::application()`. **`gpui::Application::new()` is gone** on 0.3.x (only `with_platform` / `new_inaccessible` remain).
- `gpui_kit::init(cx)` is `gpui_component::init`, which also initializes `gpui-base`. Calling both is wrong.
- Default `assets` feature is the icon pack. Without it, `IconName` / spinner / alert / select chevron break the same way they would if we dropped `gpui-component-assets` today.
- GPUI defaults to `NullHttpClient`. Remote `Avatar` `:src` (and other `img` URIs) never load until the host installs `gpui-pre-reqwest-client` via `Application::with_http_client` / `cx.set_http_client`. Kit's Storybook and `text_max_lines` example do the same. Add a direct alias: `reqwest_client = { package = "gpui-pre-reqwest-client", version = "0.3.3" }`.

Set the host crate to **edition 2024** in the same PR. That matches Kit and is the right default for a new project. Watch for edition 2024 keyword changes (`gen`, `unsafe` in `extern` blocks) in our own Rust; Kit already compiles on 2024 so the dependency side is fine.

Pin **`0.6.0`** for the migration PR (this release is hours old; `gpui-pre` already moved 0.3.1 → 0.3.3 the same day). Relax to `"0.6"` once a lockfile has proven the range.

### 3.2 Tree-sitter: all shipped languages

0.6 **does not** enable Tree-sitter on the default feature set. We enable **`tree-sitter-languages`**, Kit's full grammar bundle.

Syntax highlighting is a normal need for apps built on clj-gpui, including the author's. First-build time is accepted: the product plan is to ship **precompiled host binaries**, so application authors are not waiting on tree-sitter + GPUI/GPU in `cargo build`.

Kit still has **no** `tree-sitter-clojure` grammar (search on `v0.6.0` is empty). `(ui/editor … {:language "clojure"})` stays a best-effort / plain-text highlighter, same as today. Document the languages the feature actually enables (rust, javascript, python, html, …) in `ui/editor`. Adding Clojure would be upstream in gpui-kit, not a clj-gpui protocol change.

### 3.3 Rejected dependency shapes

- **`gpui-component = "0.6"` plus a manual `gpui-pre` pin**, without `gpui-kit`. Works, but we re-implement the facade's whole reason for existing.
- **Git dependency on `longbridge/gpui-kit`.** Unnecessary; 0.6.0 is on crates.io.
- **Staying on 0.5.1.** Fine as a "not now" product decision, but then this branch is closed. 0.5.1 will not grow Combobox/Stepper/etc., and it is stuck on GPUI 0.2.2 forever.

## 4. Naming policy: adopt Kit 0.6

No compatibility aliases. `gpui.ui` constructors, wire `:type` strings, and host `node.kind` arms use the same words Kit uses. `gpui.core` re-exports whatever `gpui.ui` interned; it must not keep the old symbols.

Bump **protocol-version to 8** in the same change: `:text-field` / `:divider` / `:table` on the wire would be a second vocabulary.

### 4.1 Constructor and wire map

| Kit 0.6 | Today (`gpui.ui` / wire) | After | Host |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Input` / `InputState` | `ui/text-field` / `:text-field` | **`ui/input` / `:input`** | already the right types |
| `Textarea` / `TextareaState` | (none) | **`ui/textarea` / `:textarea`** | new slot map, wrap in the same PR as Input/Editor |
| `Editor` / `EditorState` | `ui/editor` / `:editor` | **`ui/editor` / `:editor`** | drop `InputState::code_editor` |
| `Separator` | `ui/divider` / `:divider` | **`ui/separator` / `:separator`** | `separator::Separator` |
| `DataTable` | `ui/table` / `:table` | **`ui/data-table` / `:data-table`** | `DataTable` + `TableDelegate` |
| declarative `Table` | (none; name was taken) | **`ui/table` / `:table`** | new wrapper, Phase 5 unless it is cheap after DataTable compiles |
| `NumberInput` | `ui/number-input` | keep | still wraps `InputState` |
| `OtpInput` | `ui/otp-input` | keep | |
| `Dialog` | `ui/dialog` | keep | `Dialog::new(cx)` |
| `AlertDialog` | `:variant :alert` on `ui/dialog` | **`ui/alert-dialog`** | `WindowExt::open_alert_dialog`; no overlay-dismiss |
| `DescriptionList::separator` | (none as a Clojure method) | if we expose a row kind, call it separator not divider | |
| `row_header` | (unset) | if we expose row checkboxes, `:row-header` not `:row-selector` | |
| `has_more` | (unset) | if we expose list/table pagination, `:has-more` not `:eof` | |

Names that already match Kit stay: `button`, `checkbox`, `switch`, `slider`, `select`, `list`, `tree`, `sheet`, `popover`, `notification`, `sidebar`, `dock`, `resizable`, `spinner`, `skeleton`, `badge`, `avatar`, `tabs`, …

`clojure.core` has no `input`, so `ui/input` does not need an `:exclude`. `ui/list` already does.

### 4.2 No shims

Do not leave `ui/text-field`, `ui/divider`, or `ui/table` as aliases that paint DataTable. A two-day-old tree is cheaper to rewrite than to explain.

Call sites that must move in the same implementation:

- `src/gpui/ui.clj`, `src/gpui/core.clj` (re-export)
- `test/gpui/ui_test.clj`, `runtime_test.clj`, `core_test.clj`
- `examples/widgets`, `examples/todomvc`, `examples/themes/catppuccin-violet`
- `README.md`, `docs/protocol.md`, `docs/gpui-component.md` (replaced by a 0.6 coverage doc)
- Host: `renderer.rs` (`"text-field"` / `"divider"` / `"table"`), `overlay.rs` static paint, protocol tests that build `kind: "table"`

### 4.3 Theme tokens

`gpui.theme/register!` already passes unknown ThemeConfig keys through. New 0.6 tokens work without a Clojure schema change.

Palette *names* follow Kit's 0.6 `themes/` directory. If Kit dropped Matrix or Adventure Time, we drop them too (same "no users" argument as the widget names). Add Aurora and Asciinema.

### 4.4 Dialog overlay-closable

Follow Kit: `AlertDialog` is not backdrop-dismissible (`overlay_closable` is deprecated there). `ui/dialog` can keep `:overlay-closable` for the generic dialog. Stop forcing overlay-dismiss on `:confirm` / `:alert` variants; those become `ui/alert-dialog` or Kit's confirm/alert styling without the host override.

## 5. Breaking changes that hit *this* host

Mapped from the [v0.6.0 notes](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-kit/releases/tag/v0.6.0) onto clj-gpui code. Severity is "will not compile" vs "compiles but behavior may drift."

### 5.1 GPUI 0.2.2 → gpui-pre 0.3.x (compile)

- `gpui::Application::new()` → `gpui_kit::application()` (platform constructor).
- Official examples open windows inside `cx.spawn(async move |cx| { cx.open_window(...) })`. Our `open_window` is synchronous in `run`. Try sync first; if 0.3 requires the async open, wrap the existing `RootView` / `Root` construction in a spawn. Do not redesign the bridge for that.
- `WindowOptions`, `TitlebarOptions`, `on_window_closed`, `on_window_should_close`, `PathPromptOptions`, `HasWindowHandle` need a compile pass. Preview capture on macOS uses `raw-window-handle` 0.6 and objc2 0.6 — Kit still uses those versions, so the capture helper is more likely to need GPUI class-name / occlusion tweaks than a handle rewrite.
- `preview_macos.rs` documents that 0.2.2 pauses the display link when occluded ([zed#63217](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/63217)). Re-test Preview after the bump; `gpui-pre` is a newer Zed snapshot and may include `inactive_frame_interval` ([zed#62628](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/62628)). Keep the occlusion swizzle until proven unnecessary.

### 5.2 Input / Textarea / Editor split (compile + behavior)

0.6: `InputState` is **single-line only**. Multiline and code editing are separate entities. The Clojure API should show that split, not hide it.

| After | Host |
|---|---|
| `ui/input` | `InputState::new` + `Input::new` (today's text-field) |
| `ui/textarea` | `TextareaState::new` + `Textarea::new` — `:rows`, auto-grow, chat-style submit. Same string callbacks as input. |
| `ui/editor` | `EditorState::new(lang, window, cx)` + `Editor::new(&state)`. No `.code_editor()`, no Input-only `prefix` / `suffix` / clear / mask. |

`NumberInput` / `OtpInput` remain in `gpui_component::input`. Number-input currently shares the input `InputSlot` and `as_number` flag; share with `ui/input` keys, not with textarea/editor.

Editor change subscription (`InputEvent::Change` coalescing in `protocol::InputChangeCoalesce`) must be re-checked against `EditorState` and `TextareaState` events. Fast typing + undo grouping was already a host footgun on 0.5.1; do not assume one enum covers all three.

Default editor font is now the theme monospace, row height from font size. Outer `viewport_sized` wrappers still own Clojure `:height` / `:flex`.

### 5.3 Table → DataTable, and a free `ui/table` name (compile)

- Element: `Table::new(&state)` → `DataTable::new(&state)`.
- Clojure / wire: `ui/table` / `"table"` → **`ui/data-table` / `"data-table"`**.
- Delegate: still `TableDelegate` + `TableState<D>` in 0.6 sources.
- `fn column(&self, …) -> &Column` → `fn column(&self, …) -> Column` (**owned**). `rows.rs` must clone (or store columns in a way that returns owned values).
- If we expose the selector column, the Kit flag is `row_header` (Clojure `:row-header`).
- Pagination: `has_more`, not `is_eof`. We do not implement `is_eof` today.

Kit's new declarative `Table` is a different widget (no delegate, no virtualization story like DataTable). **`ui/table` is reserved for that.** Do not point `ui/table` at DataTable even temporarily. Wrapping declarative `Table` can wait for Phase 5; until then the name is simply unused, which is clearer than a lie.

### 5.4 Divider → Separator (compile + Clojure)

```rust
gpui_component::divider::Divider  // gone
gpui_component::separator::Separator
```

Clojure / wire: `ui/divider` / `"divider"` → **`ui/separator` / `"separator"`**. Overlay static paint and `renderer.rs` constructors switch both type and kind string. Mapping helpers for orientation/dashed stay if Separator still has them — verify at compile.

Description-list row chrome, if we ever expose Kit's `DescriptionList::separator()`, uses that name too.

### 5.5 Dialog (compile, then overlay tests)

- `Dialog::new(window, cx)` → `Dialog::new(cx)`.
- Styled `Dialog` still has `.title()`, `.confirm()`, `.alert()`, `.overlay_closable()`, `.on_ok` / `.on_cancel` / `.on_close`, and `ParentElement::extend` for children. Our live-spec builder in `overlay.rs` should port with the constructor change.
- `Root::render` still does **not** paint dialog/sheet/notification layers (confirmed on `v0.6.0` `root.rs`). The host must keep calling `Root::render_dialog_layer` / `render_sheet_layer` / `render_notification_layer` from `RootView`. Next-frame `WindowExt::open_dialog` to avoid re-entering `Root` remains the right shape.
- New **declarative** API (`trigger`, `content`, `DialogHeader`, `DialogTitle`, …) is for in-tree dialogs. Our model is controlled `:open?` via `WindowExt`. Do not switch to trigger-style in the migration PR.
- Add **`ui/alert-dialog`** for `WindowExt::open_alert_dialog`. Kit's `AlertDialog::overlay_closable` is deprecated; alerts do not dismiss on backdrop. Drop the host override that forced overlay-closable on confirm/alert variants.
- Keep `ui/dialog` for the generic / confirm dialog, including `:overlay-closable`.
- New **declarative** Dialog parts (`trigger`, `content`, `DialogHeader`, …) are optional later. Controlled `:open?` via `WindowExt` remains the clj-gpui model.

### 5.6 Dock (largest behavioral rewrite)

This is the one subsystem that is not a rename. 0.5.1 `DockItem::tabs` + `set_left_dock` / `set_right_dock` / `set_bottom_dock` / `set_center` are gone.

0.6 split:

- **`gpui_base::dock`**: pure-data `DockLayout`, `PaneTree`, persistence JSON (v0.5.0 shape kept), drag/resize.
- **`gpui_component::dock`**: `DockSkin` (chrome). Without a skin, a `DockArea` docks but draws no tab bar.

Required host changes in `renderer.rs` + `extra.rs`:

1. Build with `DockSkin::dock_area(id, version, window, cx)` (or `DockArea::new(...).with_renderer(DockSkin::new(cx))`), not a bare `DockArea::new`.
2. Wrap every `CljPanel` with `gpui_component::dock::panel_handle(panel)` before inserting. Bare `Entity<P>` compiles on the base API and then renders `panel_name` (`"clj-gpui-panel"`) instead of the title.
3. Describe layout with `DockLayout`:

   ```rust
   let center = DockLayout::tabs().panel_view(panel_handle(editor), cx);
   let left = DockLayout::tabs().panel_view(panel_handle(files), cx);
   dock.set_center(center, window, cx);
   dock.set_dock(DockPlacement::Left, left, window, cx);
   dock.set_dock_size(DockPlacement::Left, px(240.), window, cx);
   ```

   Placement accessors `left_dock()` / `set_left_dock()` are replaced by `layout(placement)`, `set_dock`, `set_dock_size`, `is_dock_open`, `remove_dock`.

4. Split `CljPanel` traits:
   - `gpui_base::dock::Panel`: `panel_name`, `closable`, `zoomable() -> bool`, dump/active callbacks.
   - `gpui_component::dock::Panel`: `title`, `zoom_control() -> Option<PanelControl>` (replaces today's `zoomable() -> Option<PanelControl>`).
5. Panel bodies stay the static overlay subset + markdown/chart (not list/data-table/editor). Persistence is still out of scope unless we decide to expose it.

Expect this to be the longest single chunk after "make it compile."

### 5.7 Smaller host API hits

| 0.5.1 | 0.6 | Our use |
|---|---|---|
| `popover_style` on `StyledExt` | `ThemeStyled` | Only if we call it (grep at compile). |
| Boolean readers `can_zoom` / `can_close` | `is_zoomable` / `is_closable` | Dock panel + any host reads. |
| Public struct fields on calendar/combobox/settings snapshots | builders + accessors | `setting::RenderOptions`, `CalendarItemState` if we construct them. |
| `History` undo API | `UndoHistory` vs navigation `History` | We do not wrap History as a widget. Editor undo is inside EditorState. |
| Charts: `ScaleBand` needs `Eq + Hash` | `BarChart` / new candlestick | `extra.rs` bar/line/area/pie. Pie index colors from PR #9 must still compile. |
| `TextView` in `gpui_component::text` | compatibility façade over `gpui-base` | `ui/markdown` / `ui/html` should keep working; re-test selection/copy. |
| Theme JSON `$schema` URL | `longbridge/gpui-kit` | Refresh vendored files. |

### 5.8 Themes and assets

Vendored palettes live in `host/themes/`, listed in `catalog.rs` and `gpui.ui/named-themes`.

0.6 theme directory (`themes/` on tag `v0.6.0`):

- **Same families we already ship:** adventure, alduin, ayu, catppuccin, everforest, fahrenheit, flexoki, gruvbox, harper, hybrid, jellybeans, kibble, macos-classic, mellifluous, molokai, solarized, spaceduck, tokyonight, twilight.
- **New in Kit:** `asciinema.json`, `aurora.json`.
- **We have, Kit 0.6 tree does not:** `matrix.json`. `named-themes` also lists **"Adventure Time"** as its own display name; confirm whether 0.6 still has that variant inside `adventure.json` or dropped it.

Tokyo Night variant names (`Tokyo Night` / `Tokyo Storm` / `Tokyo Moon`) still exist in 0.6 JSON. Token tweaks are small (e.g. `muted.background`, `input.border` presence). **Replace the vendored files from the 0.6 tag** rather than hand-merging, then diff `named-themes`.

If Kit dropped Matrix or Adventure Time, **drop them**. Add Aurora and Asciinema. `gpui.ui/named-themes` is generated from what we actually vendor from the 0.6 tag, not from 0.5.1 nostalgia.

Schema docs: [gpui-kit.com](https://gpui-kit.com) / `.theme-schema.json`. Update `host/themes/README.md` links away from `longbridge.github.io/gpui-component`.

Assets: `gpui_component_assets::Assets` → `gpui_kit_assets::Assets`. Re-check `mapping.rs` `IconName` match arms; 0.6 generates names from the new pack. Missing kebab names should fall back the same way they do today (`None` → no icon), but the gallery icons (`:bell`, `:inbox`, …) must keep resolving.

## 6. Overlay, list, and editor behavior to re-verify (not just compile)

These are the places 0.5.1 already had subtle host logic. A green `cargo test` is not enough.

1. **Dialog / sheet live spec cells** — builders must still read current `cb-N` ids; export-tree is monotonic. Overlay regression tests in `host/src/overlay_regression_tests.rs` need to compile against `Dialog::new(cx)` and Separator.
2. **Dialog callback batching** — OK → `on_ok` then `on_close`; Cancel/Escape/overlay → `on_cancel` then `on_close`; one batch so `:on-ok` cannot rewire `:on-close`.
3. **Crate dismiss vs Clojure `:open?`** — `crate_dismiss_waiting_for_clojure` / `acknowledge_dialog_tree`.
4. **One sheet** — last open in tree order. Confirm Kit still has a single active sheet on `Root`.
5. **List confirm vs select** — 0.5.1 arrows = Select only; click/Enter = Confirm, host synthesizes `:on-change` then `:on-confirm`. If 0.6 list events changed, the widgets gallery (`:list-sel` / `:list-confirm`) will show it.
6. **Table double-click batching** — `SelectRow` then `DoubleClickedRow` from one click.
7. **Editor change coalescing** — `InputChangeCoalesce` + wait-for-seq around submit.
8. **Number-input slot sharing** with `ui/input` keys.
9. **Color picker `Some` → `nil` recreate.**
10. **Date picker `set_date` skip when unchanged** (keeps the calendar open).
11. **Nested `:theme` restore** — Theme still process-global; `ThemeScope` must still pop.
12. **`preview-png`** on Linux X11/Xvfb and macOS occlusion.

## 7. New Kit surface (after today's widgets paint)

`ui/input`, `ui/textarea`, `ui/editor`, `ui/separator`, `ui/data-table`, and `ui/alert-dialog` are **in** the migration, not this list.

| Kit 0.6 | Clojure | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| declarative `Table` | `ui/table` | Reserved name. Wrap once DataTable is stable. |
| `Combobox` | `ui/combobox` | Nested `:items` are Kit `SelectGroup` / `SearchableGroup` sections. Chrome (`cleanable`, `menu_width`, `menu_max_h`, `search_placeholder`, `icon`, `check_icon`, `appearance`, `focus_ring`, string `empty`) is forwarded. `:query` is `ComboboxState::query` / `set_query` (programmatic; omitted / `nil` leaves native typing; `""` clears; Kit has no query event). Remaining: `render_trigger`, `footer`. |
| `Rating`, `Stepper`, `Pagination` | `ui/rating`, `ui/stepper`, `ui/pagination` | Straightforward controlled widgets. |
| `ProgressCircle`, `Shimmer` | `ui/progress-circle`, `ui/shimmer` | Feedback. |
| `HoverCard`, `AvatarGroup` | `ui/hover-card`, `ui/avatar-group` | Hover-driven card; overlapping avatars. `FocusTrap` still unwrapped. |
| `Command`, `NativeMenu`, `StatusBar` | `ui/command`, `ui/native-menu`, `ui/status-bar` | Clojure owns the semantic menu/command tree; the host materializes Kit NativeMenu as a show-time snapshot and holds CommandState. A generic host Action (`slot` + `item_path`) bridges Kit's required `Box<dyn Action>` without exposing GPUI Action types or capturing `cb-N`. StatusBar is independent (no Action). |
| `Message`, `Bubble`, `Attachment`, `Marker`, `MessageScroller` | `ui/message`, `ui/bubble`, `ui/attachment`, `ui/marker`, `ui/message-scroller` | First-class Kit nodes (not `{from, text}`). Host-held `MessageScrollerState`. Nested style maps for `with_stack_style` / scroller `with_*_style` / jump-button renderer / Marker `ShimmerStyle`. `:scroll-to-item` / `:scroll-to-end` are `scroll_to_item` / `scroll_to_end` (programmatic; omitted leaves native scroll; `:scroll-generation` re-applies; unresolved / rejected item is not marked applied). Remaining: an arbitrary row renderer. |
| `NavStack` | `ui/nav-stack` | Clojure-owned `:stack` of page ids; host `NavStackState` + a plan of `push`/`pop`/`forward`/`pop_to_root`/`replace` (Rebuild last resort). Host-side forward branch of retained entities; `:reuse-forward false` forces a fresh Push; `:replace-generation` is same-id Kit `replace()` bound to the current entity, not the catalog id; `:on-forward-change` is `forward_views()` nearest-first. `:transition` seconds (timing only). `:item` is a host-evaluated `NavPage` recipe for Kit `NavStack::item` (retained `view()`, Styled vocabulary, left/opacity lerp) — not an arbitrary `AnyElement` closure and not a per-frame Clojure callback. `:item :slide` / `:transition-style :slide` is opt-in; an explicit `:item` suppresses the slide fallback. Clipping is opt-in. |
| `DataTable` extras | flags on `ui/data-table` | **Wrapped.** `:header-groups`, `:cell-selectable` / `:row-header`, pixel `:row-height` / named `:size`, `:export-generation` + `:on-export`. Row and column ids restore from separate maps. Header-drag column order is host-owned across row-only and column-definition updates; a Clojure column id/order change replaces it. Native resize lives in Kit `col_groups` across row-only / header-group updates; a Clojure `:width` change still `refresh`es. `SelectColumn` is not `:on-change`. Cells are a string or a supported RenderOnce cell node (progress, tag, badge, avatar, stacks, …); `render_td` paints the overlay static subset, not input/editor/list/data-table. Cell widget ids are logical `row/id` / `col/id` (length-prefixed) or `row/index` / `col/index` when missing, so a real `"#0"` cannot collide with row 0 and header-drag reorder keeps retained widget state. Also wrapped: `:stripe` / `:bordered` / `:scrollbar`, TableState sortable/col-movable/resizable/fixed/loop/row/col-selectable, column `:sort` / `:fixed` / `:resizable` / `:movable` / min-max width, in-memory header sort + `:on-sort`, string `:empty`, `:loading` / `:has-more` / `:on-load-more`. Remaining: context menus and custom `render_th` / `render_loading`. |
| `RadarChart`, `SankeyChart`, candlestick, bar `:alignment` | `:kind` on `ui/chart` | Protocol 10. `:alignment :left` is horizontal bars for cljdu. Stacked bars stay a story-only `Plot`. |
| `SelectableText`, window `TextSelection` | maybe | Cross-element copy. Preview/Evalight might care. |
| Motion / spring | no widget | Only if we expose animation as a node. |
| Accessibility IDs / labels | optional attrs | Good later; not a blocker. |
| `gpui-fps` | `:chrome :dev` HUD | **Wanted, postponed.** Not in the migration PR. |
| Dock persistence, LSP editor | still out of scope | Same as 0.5.1 coverage doc. |

Update [docs/gpui-component.md](gpui-component.md) **after** the host compiles: retitle to GPUI Kit 0.6 coverage, add the new rows as class C. Keep the 0.5.1 file in git history; do not maintain two inventories.

## 8. Implementation phases

Work happens **in one migration PR** (this branch, after the plan lands, or a successor branch — not a spike PR plus a second PR). The numbered phases below are commit order inside that PR, not separate reviews. Land when Phase 3 is honestly done, with Phase 4 docs in the same PR. Phase 5 is a later PR.

### Phase 0 — this plan

- This file. No host code.

### Phase 1 — dependencies and edition (first commits of the migration PR)

1. `host/Cargo.toml`: `gpui-kit = { version = "0.6.0", features = ["tree-sitter-languages"] }`, `edition = "2024"`.
2. `cargo generate-lockfile` / `cargo check`.
3. Confirm rustc, Vulkan/Linux deps, and that `gpui-pre` resolved to a version Kit accepts (0.3.1 pin vs 0.3.3). If 0.3.3 breaks vs Kit's 0.3.1 pin, use `[patch]` or `=0.3.1`.
4. Fix edition-2024 fallout in our Rust if the compiler reports it.

Push these commits on the migration PR; do not open a second PR for the spike.

### Phase 2 — mechanical compile + name remap

Goal: host unit tests compile, and Clojure constructors already use Kit names (examples/tests may still be mid-rewrite).

Order of remaps (cheapest first):

1. `main.rs` application + assets + init.
2. `Divider` → `Separator`; wire `"separator"`; `ui/separator`.
3. `Table` → `DataTable`; wire `"data-table"`; `ui/data-table`; `column()` owned.
4. `"text-field"` → `"input"`; `ui/input`.
5. `Dialog::new(cx)`; add `ui/alert-dialog`.
6. `ui/editor` host: `EditorState` / `Editor`; drop `.code_editor()`.
7. `ui/textarea` + `TextareaState` slot (same change-coalesce pattern as input).
8. Dock last (see §5.6).
9. IconName / theme JSON / leftover import paths.
10. Protocol version **8**.

No `ui/text-field`, `ui/divider`, or DataTable-backed `ui/table` left in the tree.

### Phase 3 — behavioral parity under the new names

Goal: protocol-test, Clojure unit tests, and the widget gallery work with `ui/input`, `ui/separator`, `ui/data-table`, `ui/textarea`, `ui/editor`, `ui/alert-dialog`.

- Overlay tests + a real window smoke (`examples/widgets`).
- Input / textarea / editor typing, blur, language switch (even if `clojure` highlighting is weak).
- List / data-table / tree selection + confirm.
- Nested themes + Catppuccin Violet example.
- `preview-png` on Linux Xvfb; note macOS for a machine with Screen Recording.
- Counter, TodoMVC, template rewritten to the new constructors.

If a Kit default changes visible behavior (alert dialogs ignoring backdrop clicks, editor font, tab animation), **take Kit's default** and document it. Do not reintroduce 0.5.1 host overrides just to look like last week.

### Phase 4 — docs and inventory

- Point README / protocol / `gpui.ui` docstrings at gpui-kit.com.
- Document the name map (`text-field` → `input`, `divider` → `separator`, `table` → `data-table`) once in README, then use only the new names.
- Replace 0.5.1 pins in `docs/protocol.md` (protocol **8**).
- Rewrite coverage doc for 0.6 (new class-C rows, dock/editor notes).
- `host/themes/README.md` provenance.
- LICENSE note: palettes still Apache-2.0, now from gpui-kit.

### Phase 5 — remaining Kit widgets (separate PR, after the migration)

Declarative `ui/table`, then Combobox / Rating / Stepper / extra chart kinds. **`gpui-fps`** on `:chrome :dev` is in this bucket: wanted, not forgotten. Each widget gets gallery coverage. Not a dump of every 0.6 module. This is the follow-up PR (protocol 9). Extra chart kinds shipped as protocol 10 (`ui/horizontal-bar-chart`, radar, candlestick, sankey), then the same protocol version opened Kit 0.6 chart builders on `ui/chart` without extra host limits. `gpui-shell` will not be wrapped. `gpui-wry` waits until a product needs it.

## 9. Testing plan (when we implement)

| Layer | Command / action | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| Host unit | `cargo test --locked --manifest-path host/Cargo.toml` | 2–3 |
| Clojure unit | `clojure -M:test` | 3 |
| Format | `clojure -M:cljfmt check` | 3 |
| Bridge without window | `clojure -M:protocol-test` | 3 |
| Gallery | `cd examples/widgets && clj -M:dev` | 3 |
| Themes | `examples/themes/catppuccin-violet` | 3 |
| Counter / TodoMVC | existing examples | 3 |
| Preview | `gpui.runtime/preview-png` after connect | 3 |

GitHub Actions on Ubuntu and macOS covers the first four rows (`./scripts/ci.sh` on `main`, [PR #12](https://github.com/gitwyrm/clj-gpui/pull/12)). The Kit 0.6 implementation PR should stay green on that workflow. Do not add a second CI file in the bump. Gallery, themes, examples, and `preview-png` stay manual: they need a real window.

Baseline on the current 0.5.1 host (2026-09-03): `cargo test --locked --manifest-path host/Cargo.toml` — 116 passed; `clojure -M:test` — 103 tests / 626 assertions; `clojure -M:cljfmt check`; `clojure -M:protocol-test` with a debug `host/target/debug/clj-gpui`. A first `cargo test` after a cold crates.io fetch is on the order of two minutes of compile once D-Bus and libstdc++ are installed; the linker fails with `unable to find library -lstdc++` if `cc` is clang and the GCC install it selects has no `libstdc++-N-dev`.

Browser verification does not apply (native GPUI, not a web app). Closest substitute is the widget gallery + protocol-test.

## 10. Risks

- **`gpui-pre` moves independently of Kit.** 0.3.3 published the same day as 0.6.0. Lock the first compiling tree; do not float `*` on GPUI.
- **Compile time.** `tree-sitter-languages` plus GPUI/GPU is a long first build. Accepted: we will ship precompiled host binaries, so app authors are not on that path.
- **Dock rewrite regresses chrome** if we forget `DockSkin` or `panel_handle` (blank tabs / `"clj-gpui-panel"` titles).
- **Editor / textarea / input entity split** breaks slot reuse if an example reuses the same `:id` across kinds. Number-input sharing with `ui/input` is the real slot hazard.
- **Preview / occlusion** still macOS-fragile; 0.3 may help or may rename `GPUIWindow`.
- **`ui/table` unused until a follow-up PR** may look like a missing widget in the README. Call that out: data tables are `ui/data-table`.
- **No Clojure tree-sitter** — `:language "clojure"` stays cosmetic even with `tree-sitter-languages`.
- **Edition 2024** — rustc 1.85+; our own `host/src` may need small syntax fixes when switching from 2021.

## 11. Decisions

Locked before implementation:

| # | Question | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| — | Clojure / wire / host names | Kit 0.6 names. No 0.5.1 aliases. Protocol **8**. ([§4](#4-naming-policy-adopt-kit-06)) |
| 1 | Facade vs raw crates | **`gpui-kit` 0.6.0** with `gpui_kit as gpui` / `component as gpui_component` aliases. |
| 2 | Tree-sitter | **`tree-sitter-languages`** (all Kit grammars). Highlighting matters for real apps. Compile cost is accepted because we will offer precompiled hosts. Still no Clojure grammar upstream. |
| 3 | Palettes | **Follow Kit's 0.6 `themes/` list.** Drop Matrix / Adventure Time if Kit dropped them; add Aurora + Asciinema. |
| 4 | Host edition | **`edition = "2024"`.** 2021 was a mistake on a new project. |
| 5 | Declarative `Table` in the migration PR? | **No.** Reserve `ui/table`; ship data tables as `ui/data-table`. Wrap declarative `Table` in a follow-up. |
| 6 | First widgets after the migration | **Declarative `ui/table`, then Combobox / Rating / Stepper.** |
| 7 | `gpui-fps` | **Yes, later.** Wanted on `:chrome :dev`. Not in the migration PR. |
| 8 | How many PRs | **One migration PR** for crate bump + names + edition + languages + parity. Not a spike PR plus a second PR. Remaining widgets / fps are after that. |
| 9 | `gpui-shell` | **Never.** Clojure replaces that use case. |
| 10 | `gpui-wry` | **Later**, when a product needs a WebView. Not the widget coverage pass. |

## 12. What this plan PR will not do

- Implement the crate bump or the name remap (this PR is still the plan).
- Publish to Clojars or upload prebuilt host binaries (CI tests now; `--release` artifacts are a later tag workflow).
- Take a git dependency on Kit `main`.
- Introduce `gpui-shell` or WebView.
- Keep `ui/text-field`, `ui/divider`, or a DataTable-backed `ui/table` "for compatibility."
- Add `gpui-fps` yet.

When implementation starts, it is one PR: Phase 1 through Phase 4 on a single branch, ready for review only after Phase 3 holds.
